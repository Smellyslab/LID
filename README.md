# LID
a "blockchain" ledger digital ID system using QR codes, image manipulation and UUID for digital identification and proof of ownership. 

# Key Concepts
- a useable ID system for verifying ownership of digital assets without the need of running nodes for some type of expensive proof of work or proof of stake blockchain. 
- centralised but still public thus allowing digital publicity and view
- 0 log, no usernames etc only UUID and time aswell as some blockchain based data for verifcation of creation. 
- Use of RSA for message signing and other things etc. 
- downloadable, while it is centralized everone should be able to get a copy of the "blockchain" so they can verify proof of things like ID creation date, height etc.
- userfriendly, understandable by normal people while still being complex.
- small and fast, whats the point if it takes computers too long to be able to use and requires too much expensive hardware to run. 
- semi customizeable, why have something thats no fun?


# Purpose / Use cases. 
  The purpose of LID is to be able to have a way to verify ownership of digital assets without the massive hassle of programming knowledge etc.
